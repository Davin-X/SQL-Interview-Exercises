/* Windowing allows features to create a window on the set of data in order to operate aggregation like COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX and other analytical functions such as LEAD, LAG, FIRST_VALUE, and LAST_VALUE.

The syntax of the query with windows:

SELECT <columns_name>, <aggregate>(column_name) OVER (<windowing specification>) FROM <table_name>;

where,

column_name – column name of the table

Aggregate – Any aggregate function(s) like COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX

Windowing specification – It includes following:

PARTITION BY – Takes a column(s) of the table as a reference.
ORDER BY – Specified the Order of column(s) either Ascending or Descending.
Frame – Specified the boundary of the frame by stat and end value. The boundary either be a type of RANGE or ROW followed by PRECEDING, FOLLOWING and any value.
These three (PARTITION, ORDER BY, and Window frame) are either be alone or together.

--PARTITION BY
--Count Employees in each department
SELECT department, COUNT(id) OVER (PARTITION BY department) FROM emp_dept_tbl;

SELECT DISTINCT * FROM (SELECT department, COUNT(id) OVER (PARTITION BY department) FROM emp_dept_tbl) A;


--ORDER BY
--Case I: Without PARTITION
--Count Employee with salary descending order
SELECT id, department, salary, COUNT(id) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) FROM emp_dept_tbl;


--Case II: With PARTITION
--Count Employees of each department order by salary
SELECT id, department, salary, COUNT(id) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
 FROM emp_dept_tbl;

 /*
 WINDOWING Specification
In the windowing frame, you can define the subset of rows in which the windowing function will work. You can specify this subset using upper and lower boundary value using windowing specification.

The syntax to defined windowing specification with ROW/RANGE looks like:

ROW|RANGE BETWEEN <upper expression> AND <lower expression>

Here,

UPPER EXPRESSION can have these 3 value:

UNBOUNDED PRECEDING – It denotes window will start from the first row of the group/partition.
CURRENT ROW – Window will start from the current row.
<INTEGER VALUE> PRECEDING – Provide any specific row to start window
LOWER EXPRESSION

UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING – It means the window will end at the last row of the group/partition.
CURRENT ROW – Window will end at the current row
<INTEGER VALUE> FOLLOWING – Window will end at specific row
Now, let’s use these different upper and lower expression as a combination on different cases and check how it is working.
